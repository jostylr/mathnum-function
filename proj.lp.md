# [mathnum-function](# "version: 0.0.1 | jostylr")

Implementing functions for math-numbers.

This includes

1. a Fun constructor that all functions should inherit from.
2. The basic functions that everyone expects. 
3. Lots of useful generic prototype properties that can be either used or should be overwrriten. 

What I have in mind is something like  Fun.method yields a function that expects to be called with a context of a number while Fun.function would yield a stand-alone function. 

So for example  var exp = new Fun(...) could create a new function. To attach the exp function to something, we can do Num.exp = exp.method  to enable  x.exp().add(y)  to signify e^x + y.  But we could also have exp.function(x).add(y)  for the same thing.  Maybe we could let the Fun be a function so that exp(x) just works without having another variable function.

    mathnum-function
    ======================

    Functions for math-numbers.



## TODO

Lots.

## Install

This is a little node script to run after the install command is used. Currently it copies math-numbers index.js to ghpages/mathnum.js

    /*global require*/
    var spawn = require('child_process').spawn;

    spawn('cp', ["node_modules/math-numbers/index.js", "ghpages/mathnum.js"]);

## NPM package

The requisite npm package file. Use `npm run-script compile` to compile the literate program.

## gitignore

We should ignore node_modules (particularly the dev ones) and ghpages which is just a directory where I have the gh-pages branch repo. 

    node_modules
    ghpages

## npmignore

We should ignore test, examples, and .md files

    test
    examples
    ghpages
    *.md

## Travis

A travis.yml file for continuous test integration!

    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - "0.10"
